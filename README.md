# DMP Discord bot

---
### Todo
1. Reset `channelId` in `config.json` to actual DMP channel and not the test (yall on github won't be able to see this rip)
2. Archive command
    * ~~Attachments~~
    * Semi-dmps
3. Post from queue
4. Queue command
    * but only me
5. Check command
    * user inserts answer with `/check (answer*) (date)`
      * if date not entered, default to last dmp
    * also if user replies to dmp message?
6. Read from archive command?
