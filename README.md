# DMP Discord bot

---
### Todo
1. Reset `channelId` etc in `config.json` to actual DMP channel and not the test (yall on github won't be able to see this rip)
2. Archive command
    * ~~Attachments~~
    * Semi-dmps
3. ~~Post from queue~~
4. ~~Queue command~~
    * ~~but only me~~
5. ~~Check command~~
    * ~~user inserts answer with `/check (answer*) (date)`~~
      * ~~if date not entered, default to last dmp~~
    * also if user replies to dmp message?
    * autocheck that's not just directly comparing (evaluate f(x) at multiple points and check for match)
6. Read from archive command?
7. Update date input commands (`/archive`, `/queue`, `/check`) to validate date format
    * And change option types anyway
8. ~~Auto-archive on DMP post~~
9. Refactoring
    * Move date code into its own file
10. leaderboard?
