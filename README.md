### Todo
1. Reset `channelId` in `config.json` to actual DMP channel and not the test (yall on github won't be able to see this rip)
2. Archive command
  * Attachments
3. Post command
4. Schedule command
  * but only me
5. Check command
  * user inserts answer with `/check (answer*) (date)`
    * if date not entered, default to last dmp
  * also if user replies to dmp message?
